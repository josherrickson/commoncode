# Sample Code Snippets for R, SAS, Stata and SPSS

This repository contains code snippets for data cleaning, visualization and simple analysis in various languages statistical languages that have come
up in the course of consulting and may prove useful in the future. Each snippet should be self-contained and short, with documentation. If a
self-contained example is not feasible, then the documentation should be ample. Any external packages or scripts should be documented, including
version numbers (if applicable). Ideally all code snippets should exist in all languages, but that may not (and often will not) be the case. If the
method you are looking for does not exist in your language, perhaps the logic and/or algorithm from another may be of assistance.

## Contributing to this repository

Feel free to issue pull requests, or simply send me code directly. There should be no inter-dependence between files, so need to worry about testing
or otherwise checking compatibility. Your code should be categorized (and feel free to create new categories), clear and concise, well documented, and
ideally executable.

If you are able to reproduce the code snippet in multiple languages, or extend an existing snippet to a new language, that's terrific, but submitting
a new snippet in a single language is fine.

I welcome patches to existing snippets, but do keep in mind that the goal is simple, readable code, that can be easily explained and passed to users
who may have little experience in the language, so solutions which require a CS degree to understand and modify are not ideal.

### Getting started with Git

I recommend everyone use Git and contribute either via the command line or the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). There are various
tutorials and guides online, e.g. [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com).

It is possible to contribute to repositories on Github via the website, without using Git locally. While I generally am opposed to this, since this
repository does not require testing or compiling, it should be fine.
